# Flight-Hotel UI - YADDC (Yet another dribbble design challenge)

**[[Demo](https://flight-ui-challenge.surge.sh)]**

## Overview

Every week I take a top UI screenshot (at random) on dribbble and time challenge myself to recreating as much as I can in the time limit. Keeps my CSS chops sharp. 

### This Month's Challenge

Time limit: 1 hour (lunch break)

This week the Dribble is a great Dribbble called 'Flight & Hotel exploration page', [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4951422-Flight-Hotel-App-Exploration). Screenshot below:

Love the colors and layout.

### Why

These challenges help achieve the following:

1. Practice CSS with complex website layouts
2. Practice component design decomposition and component building composition
2. Be constantly exposed to latest design trends and subsequently, their CSS implementations

### Rules

- Get as close to the screenshot mockup as possible
- Chrome compat only
- No adaptive design / mobile considerations

## Tech

* React
* styled-components
* Flow

That's really it! Our React stack is super lightweight and prototype-friendly.



## Result

You can find the demo hosted [here](https://flight-ui-challenge.surge.sh). 

I didn't finish within an hour, but the layout and the big picture is nearly complete! Fun excercise.

Thanks!
