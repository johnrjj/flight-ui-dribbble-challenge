YADDC (Yet another dribbble design challenge)

Every week I take a top UI screenshot (at random) on dribbble and time challenge myself to recreating as much as I can in the time limit. Keeps my CSS chops sharp. 

This week's challenge: https://dribbble.com/shots/4951422-Flight-Hotel-App-Exploration

Time limit: 1 hour (lunch break)

Result: https://flight-ui-challenge.surge.sh
